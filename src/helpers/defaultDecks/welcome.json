    "### 🚀Welcome to Pensieve\n\nPensieve is a spaced repetition tool that keeps your ability to remember anything sharp.\n\n> \"I use Pensieve. One simply siphons the excess thoughts from one's mind, pours them into the basin, and examines them at one's leisure. It becomes easier to spot patterns and links, you understand, when they are in this form.\"\n>\n> _Albus Dumbledore_\n\n\n### 👾Use it or lose it\n\nOver time your memory of anything fades. By using that material, you will restrengthen your memory of it and keep it in your memory longer.\n\n### ⚡️How it works\nYour deck's recall bar will decrease over time. Studying these decks will replenish their strength. After repeated reviews, you will see each deck less and less.\n\n### 📬Questions\nFor questions, issues, or feedback, please contact hello@pensieve.space."
